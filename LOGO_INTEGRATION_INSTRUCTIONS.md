## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

### Step 1: Add Your Logo File
1. **Prepare your logo**:
   - Format: PNG (recommended) or JPG
   - Size: 200x60 pixels for app logo, or 100x30 for component logos
   - Background: Transparent (PNG) or white

2. **Upload the logo**:
   ```bash
   # Replace 'path/to/your/logo.png' with your actual logo file path
   sf project deploy start --source-dir force-app/main/default/staticresources/HelloSend_Logo.resource-meta.xml
   # Then manually upload the logo file through Salesforce Setup or use:
   sf project deploy start --source-dir force-app/main/default/staticresources/
   ```

### Step 2: Deploy the Changes
```bash
# Deploy all changes
sf project deploy start

# Or deploy specific components
sf project deploy start --source-dir force-app/main/default/applications/
```

### Step 3: Test the Integration
1. Open your Lightning App
2. Check the app header for your logo (next to "HelloSend" app name)
3. Verify logo displays correctly on different screen sizes
4. Confirm the logo appears consistently across all app tabs

## ðŸŽ¨ Customization Options

### App Logo Styling
The logo will automatically scale and display in the Lightning Application header. For best results:
- Use a PNG format with transparent background
- Recommended size: 200x60 pixels
- Ensure the logo is clear and readable at small sizes

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Logo Not Appearing
1. Ensure the logo file is properly uploaded to the static resource
2. Check that the static resource name matches exactly: `HelloSendLogo`
3. Verify the file format is supported (PNG, JPG, SVG)

### Component Errors
1. Check that all Aura component files are deployed
2. Ensure the component is properly registered
3. Verify the static resource is accessible

### App Logo Issues
1. Confirm the logo path in the app metadata is correct: `/resource/HelloSendLogo`
2. Check that the logo dimensions are appropriate (200x60px recommended)
3. Ensure the logo file is not corrupted

## ðŸ“± Responsive Design

The logo implementation is responsive and will work across:
- Desktop Lightning Experience
- Mobile Lightning Experience
- Lightning App Builder
- Community Builder (if applicable)

Your HelloSend application now has professional logo integration that enhances the user experience and brand consistency!
